# AI-CSC4301-Search

## Description
In this project, we (@ahmedJaafari and I) will be reproducing the pathfinding project of @SebLague and experiment different search algorithms (A*, DFS, BFS, UCS) and heuristic strategies assuming these all have the same cost in all directions and A* with different heuristics.
While running this project using unity, you can see different paths found by each strategy simultaneously with different colours and the total time it takes each strategy.
