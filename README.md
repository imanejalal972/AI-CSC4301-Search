# AI-pathfindingAstar
In this project, I will be reproducing the pathfinding project of Sebastian Lague @SebLague (https://github.com/SebLague/Pathfinding) and experiment different search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS) and heuristic strategies assuming these all have the same cost in all directions and A* with different heuristics.
While running this project using unity, you can see different paths found by each strategy simultaneously with different colours and the total time it takes each strategy.
